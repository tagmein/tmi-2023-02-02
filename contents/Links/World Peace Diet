<blockquote><p>Just
as we must harden and desensitize ourselves to produce and eat them,
our culture must produce certain hardened people to manipulate and kill the unfortunate creatures. When we make it a goal to cultivate cruelty and remorselessness in some people, all of us are hurt. In conspiring to pretend that we do not recognize the pain we cause, we deaden
the compassion, intelligence, and creativity of our children and of all
our people.</p>
<p>We silence our compassion at the circuses, rodeos, racetracks, zoos,
and other places where animals are imprisoned and used for our entertainment. In these places most of the violence and cruelty is kept hidden
from public view. If we contemplate these places deeply and educate
ourselves, however, the inherent violence becomes obvious and disturbing. The only way, for example, to get non-domesticated animals like
elephants, monkeys, tigers, dolphins, seals, and orcas to do tricks or
work is by inflicting pain and fear through beatings and electroshocks,
and/or through food deprivation. Circus trainers are taught to dominate
elephants by beating them with bullhooks, bears dance because as
babies they were forced to remain on hot metal plates while their “trainers” played music, and dolphins do tricks only because they otherwise
face the pain of hunger. Zoos imprison innocent animals, buying and
selling them to increase their revenue and the number of “baby” animals, which are by far the most lucrative attractions, while older animals typically end up in “canned hunt” facilities where they are shot as
trophies by sportsmen at point-blank range. We dull our sensitivity
when we use animals for clothing, furniture, jewelry, and other prod-
ucts, shutting down our awareness of the horror and torment inflicted
on living beings to provide them. And we stifle our empathy in scientific research and education, where we teach each other that the suffering
of non-human animals is of little consequence. It starts perhaps with
school chick-hatching projects, progresses through biology lab frog dissection, and culminates in the millions of animals tortured by
researchers working for the military, industrial, scientific, and educational establishments.</p></blockquote>
